# PRICE:

After training the model many times, I found that in each time of training, there are still the errors between the exact predicted prices and the real prices. The errors fluctuate in range [- 5, + 5]. For avoiding overfitting of the model, in prediction, we choose the weights whose errors are mostly Â±3.

# TREND:

The predicted price trend can be almost the same as the real price trend. So, it still can be used as tool for predicting HFT stock prices, but still can be improved.
